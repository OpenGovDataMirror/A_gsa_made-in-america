              With $600 billion in annual procurement spending, the U.S.
              government is the single largest purchaser of consumer goods in
              the world. Almost half of that amount is spent on manufactured
              products. From helicopter blades to trucks to medicine, it is a
              major buyer in a number of markets for goods and services.
              Ensuring clear, consistent, and transparent implementation of Buy
              American policies will help the U.S. government leverage its
              purchasing power more effectively to advance the competitiveness
              of U.S. industries.

              No. What’s the difference? There is no single “Buy America”
              statute. Rather, there are a number of statutes that require those
              receiving federal assistance to prefer goods, products, and
              materials made in the United States. For example, the Federal
              Transit Administration’s grant-making authority requires the
              steel, iron, and manufactured goods used in projects must be
              produced in the United States. The Buy American Act (BAA) is the
              primary law requiring the federal government to prefer domestic
              goods and manufactured products when making purchasing decisions.

              (FAR) provide a two-part test for determining if a product
              qualifies as a domestic end product: (i) the item must be
              manufactured in the United States, and (ii) more than 55 percent
              of the cost of all the component parts must be manufactured in the
              United States. The FAR provides various waivers and exceptions to
              the BAA. By contrast, Buy America laws are applicable to federal
              financial assistance (such as grants), not procurement.

            <p>
              The 55% threshold is currently in effect. On July 30, 2021, the
              FAR Council proposed to increase the content threshold requirement
              immediately to 60%. The Council also suggested raising the content
              threshold to 75% over the next several years. Increasing the
              content threshold percentage is intended to strengthen the
              government’s commitment to American manufacturing and make Buy
              American real. If adopted, the higher thresholds will take effect
              in accordance with timeframes set forth in the final rule. Read

              manufacturers. Supplier Scouting is a successful nationwide MEP
              service that identifies domestic manufacturers to produce
              hard-to-source and critically needed supply chain items including
              personal protective equipment (PPE) and medical supplies. Supplier
              Scouting can be applied on a national, regional or local scale. By
              leveraging our extensive relationships and knowledge of U.S.
              manufacturer capabilities, we are able to identify manufacturers’
              production and technical capabilities and connect them with supply
