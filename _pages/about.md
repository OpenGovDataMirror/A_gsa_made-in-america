# About this site

## What Is MadeinAmerica.gov?

This site is designed to promote transparency in federal procurement by enabling manufacturers and other interested parties to easily identify opportunities by reviewing waivers to Made in America laws. This renewed emphasis on Made in America laws is a key facet in a broader economic strategy to increase U.S. productivity and global competitiveness, as well as the resiliency of our manufacturing base to market volatility and manipulation.

This site provides initial information on historical waivers as well as current waivers resulting from initial implementation of Executive Order 14005: _[Ensuring the Future Is Made in All of America by All of America's Workers](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/25/executive-order-on-ensuring-the-future-is-made-in-all-of-america-by-all-of-americas-workers/){:target="\_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="usa-link--external"}_.
