# Website Policy

This website links to publicly available websites that are government-owned or government sponsored, including domains ending in .gov, .mil and .us. We may also link to quasi-government agencies and websites created by public/private partnerships; state and local government sites (e.g., maryland.gov for the State of Maryland); and government-sponsored websites that end in .com, .org, or .net (e.g., usps.com for the U.S. Postal Service).

This website may link to non-government websites, if they provide relevant information that’s not available on an official government website. We provide these links as a public service only; the U.S. government, including GSA, neither endorses nor guarantees in any way the external organizations, services, advice, or products included in these website links. Furthermore, the U.S. government neither controls nor guarantees the accuracy, relevance, timeliness or completeness of the information contained in non-government website links.

Other government and non-government links with the “external link” icon indicate that you are leaving the GSA website when you click the link.
